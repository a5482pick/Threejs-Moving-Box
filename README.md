Using only _Three.js_, _BoxControlled.html_ demonstrates a simple (but inefficient) way of rendering in perspective a 3D box that moves both automatically and in response to dragging the mouse. &nbsp;_THREE.EdgesGeometry(geometry,thresholdAngle)_ is used to specify the appearance of the box... in this demonstration, only the outer edges of the box are visible. &nbsp;There is also automatic movement of the box across the screen, while additional manual 'orbit' controls with the mouse are provided by _OrbitControls.js_.
